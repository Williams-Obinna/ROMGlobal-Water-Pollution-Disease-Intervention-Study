Global Water Pollution & Disease Intervention Study (2015–2024)

This project presents a Microsoft Excel-based analysis of water pollution and its public health impact across selected countries and regions. It explores how sanitation access, water treatment methods, and water contamination levels affect disease outcomes like diarrhoea incidence and infant mortality.

Project Overview

Objective:

To analyse global water pollution trends between 2015 and 2024, focusing on the relationship between water source quality, treatment practices, and health outcomes. The study examines factors like sanitation coverage, bacteria levels, and access to clean water in relation to public health metrics.
________________________________________
Key Findings

•	China leads in both sanitation coverage and clean water access.
•	Pond water is the most contaminated source, with the highest average pollutant levels.
•	Boiling is the most effective water treatment method for reducing bacteria.
•	The South region reported the highest average diarrhea cases.
•	2023 had the highest infant mortality rate, followed by a sharp decline in 2024.

Methodology

Tools Used:

•	Microsoft Excel
•	Pivot Tables & Slicers
•	AVERAGEIFS, COUNTIFS
•	Donut, Bar, and Line Charts
•	Conditional Formatting
•	Excel Dashboards

Approach:

•	Time-based and regional analysis of sanitation, treatment, and outcomes
•	Water source categorization and contaminant comparison
•	Cross-variable comparison with healthcare access and mortality
________________________________________
Recommendations

•	Expand sanitation and clean water infrastructure in high-risk countries like Ethiopia and Pakistan.
•	Promote boiling as a simple, low-cost, high-impact treatment method.
•	Prioritize public health investment in regions with high diarrhea incidence.
•	Combine WASH (Water, Sanitation, Hygiene) efforts with healthcare initiatives.
